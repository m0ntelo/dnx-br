        <div class="post-content-description">
          Our team combines knowledge of software engineering and cloud, 
          allowing us to<br> provide services that covers the whole stack - 
          from the cloud server to the code running<br> in devs machines.
        </div>
        <div class="post-content-description">
          No proprietary technology - We do <b>infrastructure-as-code</b> with 
          Terraform (an open-<br>source tool) to create and<br> maintain 
          your cloud. Our platform is publicly documented and maintained 
          by us so you don't need to worry about lock-ins.
        </div>
        <div class="post-content-description">
          And to keep your team able to manage their new platform and 
          keep delivering value, we<br> help lifting them with workshops, 
          cloud mentorship and support.

          <div class="post-content-card-title">Agility</div>
          <div class="post-content-card-description">
            The agile methodology taught us to deliver value 
            early and often. We apply these concepts with our 
            clients so we progress faster and detect issues 
            earlier, preventing  rework.
